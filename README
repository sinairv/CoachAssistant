Copyright (C) 2004-2006 Sina Iravanian  <sina.iravanian@gmail.com>

Coach assistant is a tool for creating positioning patterns and visualizing them 
for a team of coachable players. It can also serve as a tool for visual analysis 
of the players and their relative positions. It generates Coach Language 
(CLang for short) statements for the strategy assigned to the team. The generated 
CLang may need little modification to form a complete team's strategy.
